# Tie Shirt - put together a tie and a shirt

This is a really simple app. The idea is simply to give a way to quickly and easily
combine shirt and tie combinations visually so that you can see what the combination
will look like.


## Layout

Something like this:

<pre>

1. Shirt:    this will be filled with a pattern or solid color, independently from
              the tie
2. Tie:      this will be filled with a pattern or solid color as well, independently
              from the shirt
3. Swatches: clipped patterns taken from photographs or made in the pattern designer


## Planned Features

- **pattern extractor**: import a picture with a pattern you like in it, then draw a
  box around the pattern to add it to your swatches
- **drag-and-drop**: drag pictures into the app to open them in the pattern extractor
- **color picker**: use a color picker widget to select solid color patterns


## Pie-in-the-Sky Features

- **pattern auto-extractor**: when selecting a pattern from a picture, simply click in
  the middle of the patterned area; the app will attempt to automatically identify the
  pattern and create a normalized swatch using image processing
- **other articles**: add support for dresses, blouses, pants, suits, vests, etc.;
  eventually you could build an entire very complicated wardrobe
